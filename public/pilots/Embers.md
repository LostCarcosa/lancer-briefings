In a distant world far from the cradle, one of the most well known lancers of the galaxy emerged - a famed sniper called Nasir the Eagle-Eyed.

His homeworld was barren and poor, and viewed his military success and protection with a near religious zeal. When his eventual death ultimately came, his peoples used the considerable wealth he left behind for a single goal: to always ensure that Nasir was there to protect them.

A cloning project came into being, creating an unbreaking line of Nasirs that lived and died, but with each successive cognitive template being more fraught with issues than the last. Although the project continued to culminate the experience of a thousand battles, the resulting clones became more and more unstable as a result; perhaps due to the imperfect methodologies of the scientists.

Khalid came into being as the latest incarnation. The cognitive template did not "stick" successfully - and therefore he was abandoned from the project, memory full of holes, driven half-mad by dreams of wars past and present. But still, some scraps of Nasr's skills remained in his psyche, and he was ultimately picked up by a mercenary group as a mech pilot.
