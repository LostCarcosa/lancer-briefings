Vesper is the youngest child of an old and prominent family line, of which almost all the members hold distinguished careers in business, politics, or the military. As the baby of the family, Vesper’s own promotion as a lancer came about as a questionable mix of genuine talent, favor-currying, and nepotism. She’s spent her whole life balancing unfair privileges against unfair expectations, and now that Vesper’s finally free of her overbearing family’s direct influence, she does her utmost to conceal her lineage in the hopes of making a name for herself on her own merits.
