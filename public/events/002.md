## A Break in the Fighting
The party, bereft of their chassis, arrives at FOB Saber, and is greeted by Staff Sargeant Garcia. Garcia directs them toward the base printer to get their mechs rebuilt, and tells them to get some rest.

1st Lt. Alex Kim contacts the party over their omnihook to commend them for taking out VSAF C47 TYFONAS, allowing Union reinforcements to arrive safely, and awards them their first License Level- unlocking a few new systems/weapons for each member of the party (although a truly custom frame won't be available until LL2). 

The party takes a very brief downtime- only a few days. 

Astri gathers intel on Cressidium, gaining advance information on one of the sitreps they'll be facing, but in their digital digging leaves traces of their meddling behind. 

Khalid steps out to scout the surrounding terrain & city, and gathers enough intel to add a deployment zone to any one combat- but also is nearly caught by a pair of Sovereignty foot soldiers, though he luckily escapes with help from his Camo Cloak.

Vesper gets a Damn Drink, which spirals a little out of control. She loses her Good Reputation, but gains a Convenient Opportunity, which she can expend at any appropriate time.

Hypatia spends her time Getting Focused by reading a book on herbs & flowers, and gains a new trigger: +2 to Botany.

Although Union is still working under a policy of noninterference, their sympathies certainly lean toward the LSA. LSA troops have been allowed inside FOB Saber under the guise of humanitarian efforts, and some of the materiel printed by the base printer *may* mysteriously find itself in LSA hands.

Over this downtime, reports arrive that LSA reinforcements are beginning to amass outside the city, preparing to retake territory. Sovereignty forces are beginning to reposition, moving to secure key points and defend from this external assault. Still, the jamming signal blankets the city, shattering LSA communications and putting them at a heavy disadvantage.

## Clear the Air
Lt. Alex Kim contacts the party after a few days of rest and recuperation. It's time to finish this deployment and collect the VIPs. A new mission begins.

The first step of this mission is to shatter the jamming network, which is made up of a wide system of interference towers scattered across the city. Shipboard NHPB Rio has concocted a viral kill-package that should be able to kill the entire network, but it'll require physical access to upload. The party's first task is to reach a nearby interference tower- no doubt heavily guarded- take control over it, and then upload the killcode.

After the jamming network is destroyed, Rio will be able to locate Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee via digital trackers, and the players will be deployed to retrieve them. If the destruction of the jamming network also *happens* to help the LSA in retaking the city... well, that's just a nice coincidence, isn't it?

As the party deploys and approaches the interference towers, their sensors begin glitching from the heavy digital interference. Visual artifacts and ghost images begin flickering upon their screen- and then moments later, these digital ghosts open fire.

The party is thrown into combat with enemies well-equipped for technological warfare. The OPFOR consists of:
- ACE
- ASSASSIN
- BREACHER
- DEMOLISHER
- VETERAN MIRAGE
- WITCH

Notable among these is the Mirage, who is persistently invisible and has the ability to easily move their slower allies across the battlefield. 

The two sides vie to control the area, trying to claim four Control Points. Within the first round, the Witch reveals a dangerous ability, Predatory Logic, and hacks into Horizon and forces them to shoot Rigamarole with their great big sniper rifle. 

On the bright side, the party has more of their own movement abilities now, and with new systems begins to maneuver toward some control points of their own.
