# Nov Elysia // 4.16.5013u
## A Break in the Fighting
The party, bereft of their chassis, arrives at FOB Saber, and is greeted by Staff Sargeant Garcia. Garcia directs them toward the base printer to get their mechs rebuilt, and tells them to get some rest.

1st Lt. Alex Kim contacts the party over their omnihook to commend them for taking out VSAF C47 TYFONAS, allowing Union reinforcements to arrive safely, and awards them their first License Level- unlocking a few new systems/weapons for each member of the party (although a truly custom frame won't be available until LL2). 

The party takes a very brief downtime- only a few days. 

Astri gathers intel on Cressidium, gaining advance information on one of the sitreps they'll be facing, but in their digital digging leaves traces of their meddling behind. 

Khalid steps out to scout the surrounding terrain & city, and gathers enough intel to add a deployment zone to any one combat- but also is nearly caught by a pair of Sovereignty foot soldiers, though he luckily escapes with help from his Camo Cloak.

Vesper gets a Damn Drink, which spirals a little out of control. She loses her Good Reputation, but gains a Convenient Opportunity, which she can expend at any appropriate time.

Hypatia spends her time Getting Focused by reading a book on herbs & flowers, and gains a new trigger: +2 to Botany.

Although Union is still working under a policy of noninterference, their sympathies certainly lean toward the LSA. LSA troops have been allowed inside FOB Saber under the guise of humanitarian efforts, and some of the materiel printed by the base printer *may* mysteriously find itself in LSA hands.

Over this downtime, reports arrive that LSA reinforcements are beginning to amass outside the city, preparing to retake territory. Sovereignty forces are beginning to reposition, moving to secure key points and defend from this external assault. Still, the jamming signal blankets the city, shattering LSA communications and putting them at a heavy disadvantage.

# Nov Elysia // 4.19.5013u
## Clear the Air
Lt. Alex Kim contacts the party after a few days of rest and recuperation. It's time to finish this deployment and collect the VIPs. A new mission begins.

The first step of this mission is to shatter the jamming network, which is made up of a wide system of interference towers scattered across the city. Shipboard NHPB Rio has concocted a viral kill-package that should be able to kill the entire network, but it'll require physical access to upload. The party's first task is to reach a nearby interference tower- no doubt heavily guarded- take control over it, and then upload the killcode.

After the jamming network is destroyed, Rio will be able to locate Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee via digital trackers, and the players will be deployed to retrieve them. If the destruction of the jamming network also *happens* to help the LSA in retaking the city... well, that's just a nice coincidence, isn't it?

As the party deploys and approaches the interference towers, their sensors begin glitching from the heavy digital interference. Visual artifacts and ghost images begin flickering upon their screen- and then moments later, these digital ghosts open fire.

The party is thrown into combat with enemies well-equipped for technological warfare. The OPFOR consists of:
- ACE
- ASSASSIN
- BREACHER
- DEMOLISHER
- VETERAN MIRAGE
- WITCH

Notable among these is the Mirage, who is persistently invisible and has the ability to easily move their slower allies across the battlefield. 

The two sides vie to control the area, trying to claim four Control Points. Within the first round, the Witch reveals a dangerous ability, Predatory Logic, and hacks into Horizon and forces them to shoot Rigamarole with their great big sniper rifle. 

On the bright side, the party has more of their own movement abilities now, and with new systems begins to maneuver toward some control points of their own. Rigamarole claims the SW control point, while Nova, Horizon, and Bombs Away all claim the SE one. The Sovereignty immediately claims both northern control points in response.

The Sovereignty soon claims an early lead, however, as it holds onto its northern points and deploys its faster units (Ace and Assassin) to contest the southern ones, pulling forth a two-point lead- but the party eventually closes the cap, blowing up the ACE and relentlessly bullying the Witch into a retreat. Rigamarole and the Assassin duel to a standstill, until the Mirage calls the Assassin to the SE point instead; Bombs Away contests the NE point from the Breacher, and survives three entire rounds of high damage shotguns to hold the zone. 

The Mirage pulls its Demolisher and Assassin to the Eastern CZs, while remaining largely untouchable itself due to permanent invisibility and its extra Structure. Ultimately, however, the party manages to *barely* swing the victory, winning the Control by 1 point, making use of every single action to do so. 

The party claims the jamming node, and then takes Rio's viral kill-package and uploads it to the entire network- shattering the comm jam the Sovereignty has imposed over the entire city.

A flood of urgent communications flood across the now-cleared comms signals, overwhelming everything to the point of incomprehensibility. When the voices finally clear, reports begin coming in- the LSA reinforcments are now coordinating their approach to the city, backed by Union forces on the ground, and- fighting in their home territory and with radio back online- now have a decisive advantage.

Rio interrupts this thought- she's located the Captain's signal. A Union transport ship is coming to pick you up. Go get'em, Lancers.

## Leviathan

The party approaches the Port of Nov Elysia, spotting the figures of Ambassador Bannerjee and Captain Ferris being forcibly led toward a submarine. Before the lancers can deploy, the VIPs are already aboard, and enemy troops- having spotted the Union dropship- begin to deploy. 

Luckily, Khalid had performed some scouting during downtime, and the party was able to make use of this info to get the jump on VSAF forces, deploying much closer to the submarine than the would have otherwise been able to. 

The OPFOR defending the submarine consists of:
- SNIPER
- ELITE BARRICADE
- COMMANDER SCOUT
- VETERAN PYRO
- SCOURER
- HORNET

The fight was quite hard fought, but the party quickly wiped out a significant portion of the OPFOR, aided in part by some truly unfortunate structure rolls on the OPFOR's part- with the Elite Barricade being taken out abnormally quickly. Rigamarole and Bombs Away quickly boarded the sub, contending with the Scout and Sniper, while Horizon and Nova got tangled up dealing with the Pyro, Scourer, and Hornet.

The Pyro and Scourer demonstrated some remarkable teamwork, stacking a record 14 Burn on Nova. Horizon managed to miraculously avoid the Pyro's flamethrower, though the party struggled to deal with the Pyro's ranged resistance and high armor (wasting multiple attacks on it that just pinged right off). 

Still, the party endured well, taking only three structure total over the entire fight- narrowly avoiding one as Rigamarole's Custom Paint Job let her tank a full 1 structure Sniper shot. Party resolves the situation within 5 rounds, with the fifth round being entirely dedicated to the overheated Pyro kamikazi-ing Horizon (who still managed to dodge the last ditch probably illegal 22-heat explosive vent). At endtime, OPFOR consisted of one SNIPER and one HORNET, the latter of which could not actually do meaningful damage.

The party storms the submarine, facing no other serious opposition, and secures **Captain Farris** and **Ambassador Bannerjee**, who are naturally very grateful to see them. Captain Farris commands them for their performance in the fight above, and the party + VIPs prepare to extract. Rigamarole has an expanded compartment that could fit one of them, and after an extended argument between the pair, it is decided that Bannerjee (with no military experience) will remain in the compartment, much to his dismay, while Captain Farris travels on foot. 

The party heads outside to wait for evac.

## Wake the Furies

The Union transport ship that dropped off the players circles back around to pick up the expanded party, preparing to take them all back to the safety of the **Rio Grande**, still hovering above the planet.

As it closes in, a great laser erupts from ground level, carving the ship in half like a hot knife through butter. The laser continues onward, carving a path through multiple buildings and then the ground in front of the lancers, like a great line in the sand. The docks rapidly ignite, coating the area in a smoggy haze.

**VSAF EX-101 NEMESIS** emerges atop a building, before immediately teleporting to ground level- an ULTRA OPERATOR wielding a great laser-cycle lance (among an array of other weaponry). A voice crackles over the newly opened comms- declaring that the party is to be rent apart. "Burn it all. No survivors."

NEMESIS is joined by a ELITE HIVE and PYRO, whose presence only serves to intensify the flames. More enemy units prowl on the site's perimeter. One last challenge before the party can complete their hard-fought mission.

You have permission to engage. Wipe them out.

### Combat Report**

**Nemesis** opened with a display of overwhelming firepower, teleporting across the field and launching a devastating attack with its Short Cycle Lance, hitting *three* lancers at once and destroying many of the cargo crates serving as cover. Unfortunately, the poor HIVE and PYRO took significantly longer to enter the contested area.

Nemesis proved immensely difficult to deal with- boasting an extremely accurate, long-range, high-damage rifle, a set of seeking missiles to hunt down enemies in cover, the constant threat of the laser lance recharging, and the ability to turn invisible between its turns, which frustrated many of the attacks thrown at it. 

The Hive soon singled out Horizon as its main target, while the Pyro engaged in a duel with Rigamarole. Nemesis spent several rounds whittling the party down, taking very little damage in the process, slowly stripping away their structure while the party burnt away their own stress as they Overcharged to keep up. 

Several GRUNTs arrived on the field but were almost immediately nuked by Nova.

Horizon worked on eliminating the Hive, working with Bombs Away to wipe it out- but was unfortunately then taken out by Nemesis and a very unlucky structure roll. Khalid retreated, taking their anti-mech pilot weapon to a safe point and getting ready to take a shot if the situation ever became truly desperate.

Bombs Away dropped to exactly two hit points remaining on their last structure and then survived for a remarkably long time, managing to structure Nemesis *twice*- once with a grenade and once with a 15-damage HMG blast. They then tanked a full laser that only managed to drop them to 1 hit point before Nemesis overcharged to finally take out this massive thorn in their side. (On the flip side, Bombs Away also displayed some remarkably cursed luck, rolling an aberrant number of 1s and 2s on their attack rolls.)

Nova provided support to the rest of the party, keeping the Hive and Pyro in suboptimal positions, but found themselves unable to do much direct damage to the operator, and also unable to reliably hack them due to invisibility. They did manage to work together with Bombs Away to chip away the Operator's health, while taking heavy damage in the process. After spending an unreasonable amount of actions, Nova did manage to hurl the Operator off a crate and into the residue of an explosive barrel, managing to Expose the Operator and leave them extremely susceptible to damage.

Rigamarole spent most of the fight solo'ing the Pyro, juggling a rapidly building burn with the need to reliably do damage. The Pyro's heavy armor once more proved troublesome- rendering all turret drones useless and blunting every hit to rather middling damage. By the time they finally extracted their smouldering mech from the combat, Nemesis had eliminated the entire rest of the squad.

Nemesis headed for Rigamarole to finish them off- immediately structuring them and leaving them at 1 structure, 1 stress, and Exposed- but Rigamarole hit a lucky shot, piercing Nemesis's invisibility and dealing just enough damage- due to their Exposed condition- to wipe them out. Upon its destruction, Nemesis immediately self-immolated, leaving little trace of their existence. 

Ambassador Bannerjee is having a very bad time in the back of Hypatia's mech. 

Victorious, the party collects their VIPs from the smouldering port, and prepares to extract. Another dropship- with a rather nervous pilot, given that this party's last two dropships were cleaved in half- picks them up and escorts them back to the Rio Grande. 

Later, there is to be celebrations and commendations. But for now:

## Mission Complete.
