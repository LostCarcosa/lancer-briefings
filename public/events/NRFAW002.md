# Evergreen // Late Spring, 5014u


Our party of Lancers is woken in the dark of night by the beeping of an alarm they did not set. The time reads `44:44`.

Before they have time to properly contemplate this, they hear gunfire erupt in the distance. They are needed.

## Knife Through the Heart

By the time the PCs arrive in their heavy mechanized chassis, there's already a pitched battle going on at the walls. Attackers- once more clad in insectoid carapace and the foliage of the forest- are mounting a concentrated assault, seeking to breach the walls. Quickly, the party readies their arms and gets to work.

### Combat Report: Night Strike

The party is forced into a Holdout against multiple enemy units, including a new versatile **STRIDER**-class mech. Said STRIDERS demonstrate impressive adaptability on the field, swapping easily from entrenched warfare to mobile skirmishing to siege weaponry.

Accompanying two STRIDERS are a pair of **ARCHERS**, a **BOMBARD**, and a **SPECTER**. Our Lancers have a strong defensive position with Evergreen's walls, but there's enough scattered debris in the fields for the OPFOR to manage some degree of cover.

While the BOMBARD stays in the backline raining down fire from afar, the ARCHERS and STRIDERS close to midrange to hassle the party, with the ARCHERS haranguing **Diplomacy** while the STRIDERS take shots at the lancers remaining atop the walls. Meanwhile, the SPECTER simply warps right into our Lancers' backline and immediately starts committing acts of great violence, using its invisibility to tank an improbable amount of hits before **Rhythmless Walk** finally obliterates them.

Overall, our pilots take a few scratches and bruises but acquit themselves well in battle, and take out the OPFOR quite smoothly. They in fact do well enough that they find the time to Scan some of the attackers for information, but fail to learn much of importance- these mechs are all unregistered and their pilots unknown to the world at large. Still, unlike the "mechs" at the Chau farmhouse, these mechs *are* definitely piloted- our Lancers see humanoid shapes pop out of destroyed mechs and flee into the forest.

The OPFOR, however, behaves slightly oddly- refusing to retreat even when dropped to 3 members...

though the reason for that quickly becomes clear at the end of round 5, when the sound of combat rings out from downriver. The forested assailants fall back, their job complete...

# Evergreen Power Plant // Late Spring, 5014u

### Combat Report: Night Strike

> `>//PRIORITY:::STABLE REACTORS REPORTING MULTIPLE UNKNOWN CONTACTS:::WATCHPOINT 1 BREACHED:::WATCHPOINT 2 BREACHED:::EMERGENCY EMERGENCY EMERGENCY:::ALL MILFORCE DIVERT ASSETS TO HOLD+SECURE ACTION IMMEDIATELY:::PUSH CONFIRM`
> [PRIORITY MESSAGE - PATIENCE]

The attack at the gates was just a feint, buying time for their comrades downriver. The party arrives at Stable Reactor Tower 2, crashing through the warfare surrounding it to find a group of reinforced mechs having claimed the area. Stable Reactor Tower 1 is already destroyed- shattered by immense violent force- and if Evergreen's other power reactor tower is broken, the colony will be left without power.

This OPFOR seems somewhat sturdier than the one at the gates- it seems the real combat's here. Attacking the Reactor directly is a **VETERAN COMMANDER DEMOLISHER**, who is guarded by 4 **GRUNT RONINS**, a **PRIEST**, a **CATAPHRACT**, a **SUPPORT**... and an **ELITE VETERAN STRIDER** named **VENOM**.

Who just so happens to be the sniper the party *didn't* pursue in Mission 001.

The DEMOLISHER remains focused on destroying the reactor, wielding its immense (but slow) Demolition Hammer- capable of destroying said reactor in just two hits. It doesn't seem like it'll get *much* of a chance to do so, however, as **Nebula** immediately jams it, forcing it to resort to improvised attacks.

The party takes some damage from the supporting cast of enemies (with Diplomacy taking fire for their frailer allies) but quickly cuts down key members of the OPFOR, taking out the PRIEST to prevent it from buffing the DEMOLISHER and soon clearing the field of grunts. Before the DEMOLISHER even gets to take a proper swing at the reactor, Rhythmless Walk shoots and breaks its great hammer, and **No Escape** manages to grapple it and drag it away (being the only mech big enough to move the DEMOLISHER's bulk).

VENOM remains a problem, wielding a high-powered sniper rifle and potent close-range knockback tech... at least until it overcharges a bit too much and triggers a self-destruct sequence. Still, unwilling to go so easily, VENOM prepares to charge directly toward the reactor to try to take it out...

At least until Nebula Hurls it Into the Duat, turning it into an ally and causing it to charge directly into the DEMOLISHER and SUPPORT instead, blowing all three up in a great fireball.

The rest of the OPFOR folds handily, and the Evergreen militia finally breaks through the combat surrounding the reactor, forcing these assailants into retreat. Evergreen's reactor is saved! 

As a bonus, Hypatia dismounts from her mech and manages to subdue one of the assailants fleeing on foot, managing to take them prisoner. 

**[Defenses of Evergreen] clock increases by 1.**

## Elegy for the Dead

During the previous fight, the party managed to scan VENOM for information on their pilot- which revealed that it was piloted by Psalm, a pilot wanted for multiple charges of piracy. Psalm actually escaped the fight, having Ejected from VENOM at the last moment before its immolation, and disappeared into the night.

The party travels back toward Evergreen on a mechanized transport, dragging their unidentified (and uncooperative) prisoner along. During the ride back, Astri discovers the somewhat worrying fact that her OSIRIS-Class NHP seems to be missing, replaced by a friendly- and rather useless- facsimile claiming the same name. Their STUDENT-class NHP- who doesn't seem to have linguistically advanced beyond emojis yet- tried to investigate, but found nothing.

As the party approaches Evergreen, their concerns regarding OSIRIS are cut short as the silence of the night is interrupted by a horrible metallic scream from the edge of the forest- followed by a burst of movement as a hulking mech bursts from the treeline, drippling plasmic slag, and clears Evergreen's walls in a single great bound, crashing recklessly into the city- all while their reactor screams under horrible strain. The party rushes in to respond, and they meet...

### Combat Report: REGRET

With both advance forces of forest raiders being taken out by the Lancers, one *final* opponent lurches onto the battlefield- a horribly unstable chassis, salvaged and sent to its grim purpose. **REGRET** drips plasmic waste as it crashes through the city, leaving a trail of fire wherever it goes, heading on a direct course toward Evergreen's omninode.

REGRET will not survive this mission- their mech is essentially a walking reactor meltdown. But they might just take out Evergreen's access to the Omninet before they die...

Our lancers intercept REGRET in one of the residential districts bordering the Omninode. Due to the inhabited civilian buildings nearby, the lancers must be cautious to avoid causing unnecessary collateral damage (and to prevent regret from doing the same).

The enemy OPFOR consists of:
- **REGRET** (Ultra Berserker)
- ELITE SUPPORT
- GENGHIS MK.1 WORLDKILLER (Size 2 Pyro; removed due to player absence)
- 4x GRUNT RONIN

The objective is twofold: Kill REGRET before their frame melts down in a cataclysmic explosion, and protect the surrounding buildings from destruction. If REGRET successfully destroys all mechs and/or our lancers flee, it will be free to wipe out the Omninode; if instead REGRET melts down, they will fail to eliminate the omninode but will cause substantial collateral damage in the surrounding area.

The first round goes remarkably poorly, with REGRET taking a grand total of two (2) damage thanks to their Stampede Defense while absolutely shredding into the players with the ability to pull off a consistent barrage of attacks. The Hellfire Projector proves to be the cruelest weapon in play, dealing 3 energy and 4 burn damage in *two* CONE 5 areas, and rapidly destroying a nearby inhabited building.

However, as the lancers begin to find their footing, they rapidly begin to recover. No Escape invades REGRET to effectively shut off their resistances, while Rhythmless Walk perches upon a building so they can fire their railgun downward and avoid hitting buildings along the way. Once the artilleries get going, they quickly find they *can* rain down an impressive amount of damage, outstripping the SUPPORT's ability to patch & heal REGRET's collapsing frame.

Still, the party takes heavy damage in the process, as REGRET continues to set everybody ablaze, leaving most people at less than 20 total HP across their remaining structures and breaking most of their weapons. Rather uncharacteristically, Nebula manages to survive until their last structure, and decides to trigger the Lancer's final move, which is just self-destructing.

With the Symbiosis combo, Nebula and Diplomacy launch a series of invades onto REGRET to expose them, before Nebula detaches and launches themselves toward the unstable frame.

With stampede defense gone, the Exposed REGRET takes 30 damage, narrowly but instantly killing them. Regret's wreck collapses into hot, radioactive slag; no pilot crawls out of the destroyed frame. The ELITE SUPPORT and remaining GRUNT RONIN retreat, but are eliminated by Evergreen's militia.

## Downtime

The party is commended for their performance; all fronts of Evergreen were successfully defended, and damage was kept to a minimum. The attacks seem to come to an end, and the coming weeks are downright peaceful.

As late spring bleeds into early summer and the Hercynian cidadas begin their song, a new development occurs. The first visitors to Hercynia since our lancers' arrival descend into Evergreen's (now-unflooded) landing bowl in a small subline corvette. Five individuals come out, all bearing the insignia of **Landmark Colonial**.

This is a Landmark Crisis Response Team, sent here to investigate the issues plaguing their colony. The five come to greet the lancers, introducing themselves as **CRT Contingency White**, and more specifically as **Eddie Wu** (Team Leader), **Roy "Mauler" Kaul** (Demolitions), **Basalm Singh** (Medic), **Emma Broadstreet** (Soldier), and **Anne Laurent** (Tech & NHP handler). Wu- a gruff, scarred veteran- does most of the talking for the team, making it clear that they're not here to steal the Lancers' job- the CRT's task is investigation & data collection, not frontline warfare (though they each *have* brought along a functional mechanized chassis). The two teams reach a verbal agreement to stay out of each others' way. Still, there's definitely a sense that our lancers' privileged position upon the planet is suddenly no longer as exclusive as it once was.

Astri's **OSIRIS**-class NHP is sent to Patience for diagnostics. Patience is a little overtaxed right now due to the strain these direct attacks have placed on Evergreen, but within a few weeks clues Astri into the fact that the piece of aberrant code they recently installed onto their mech *might* be causing some issues. Astri spends the downtime erecting security protocols around Cynosure to prevent this infection from going any further, and succeeds with flying colors- though before the last firewall is activated, one last message pops up on their HUD:

`3002 - WONDER WHY`

Khalid salvages the enemy mechs and leans upon their reputations as the saviors of Evergreen to get Fielding to allocate him some engineering corps space; with these, he completes his Disposable Heat Sink, a one-use item to take some of the edge off of his high-heat guns. This reserve allows him to stabilize once as a free action. 

Vesper spends her downtime slowly persuading the prisoner they took during Reactor Defense. This prisoner- who still refuses to give a name- is a tough nut to crack, but through weeks of delicate persuasion and demonstrations of general goodwill, Vesper manages to get them to talk (if only a little). Pushing for their motives, the prisoner finally cracks- telling Vesper that they need to "get off our planet". They seem to be able to speak Union common, but it's heavily accented and somewhat fragmented. Vesper gives them some chocolate (mooched from their baker friend) and the prisoner takes it, but mutters something about "different face, same people".

[Hypatia downtime goes here]
