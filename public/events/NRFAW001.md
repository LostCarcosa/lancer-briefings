# Union Dropship  // 4.30.5013u
Union Crisis Response Task Force, consisting of **Astri 3133** (Callsign: **SEEKER**), **Hypatia Doe** (Callsign: **MIMOSA**), **Khalid** (Callsign: **EMBERS**), and **Vesper** (Callsign: **FLARE**), has been deployed to the planet **Hercynia** in response to a distress call from the settlement **Evergreen**. Along with your deployment orders, you recieve the following briefing regarding the situation on the planet:

> System: Ardennes-3
> 
> Gate: Atlas-Quanokrim
> 
> Planet: Hercynia
> 
> Gate: Atlas-Line
> 
> Details:
> 
> **Hercynia**- rediscovered circa 4943u. Wet, temperate climate; breathable atmosphere. Gravity is 0.94 galactic standard. 20-hour day, 305 day year. Extant flora and fauna on planet. Overall: 9.4/10 habitability.
> 
> Hercynia was colonized by **Landmark Colonial** (a subsidiary of **Smith-Shimano Corpro**), which established the settlement of **Evergreen** in 4964u. Colonization efforts are still young. There are no competing colonial efforts.
> 
> Hercynia was once part of SecComm's expansionary efforts. Few records remain regarding SecComm's original colonization of the planet; expect occasional military debris, including but not limited to unexploded ordnance and radioactive waste.
> 
> Deployment:
> 
> Evergreen requests aid due to a series of attacks beginning in 5012u upon the colony, executed by unidentified, well-armed assailants. Assist Evergreen and stabilize the situation upon the ground. 

The party is transferred from Rio Grande to a interstellar transport vessel, beginning the long journey to Hercynia. 



# Hercynia // Early Spring 5014u

## Ground Party
After a long year, the new Union Task Force finally arrives. From above, Emerald Hercynia is a beautiful mass of blues and greens, cloaked by swirling clouds. Covered in dense forest and jungle, with deep ravines of gray stone and great mountains rising in the distance, the vast planet awaits.

During the descent, the dropship pilot is forced to land in a seemingly random strip of the forest- Evergreen's landing bowl is out of commission due to flooding. As our lancers step into the heavy, humid air of Hercynia, they are greeted by a small armed group led by **Brava Hadura**, commander of Evergreen's militia. Brava is glad to see that the calvary has arrived, but quickly ushers them toward the relative safety of Evergreen's walls. Though friendly, she keeps a constant eye on the surrounding forest, staring at the swaying grass and dense foliage.

Upon arrival, Brava leads the party to the **Bottom of the Well Tavern**, where rooms have already been prepared for them. She gives them a brief overview of Evergreen- a young city of about ~15k people- and tells them that Evergreen's Administrator will probably want to meet them in a few days, but they have some time to settle in and get familiar with the city first, pointing them toward a few activities they could partake in.

Hypatia, Astri, and Vesper all take a bit of downtime to get familiar with the city. Vesper goes to the Well's karaoke night, leaps on stage, and flubs their performance, doing well *until* the very climax of the song. They still win some goodwill from Evergreen's citizens, but don't really impress anyone with their performance.

Astri goes outside the walls and joins the excavation efforts, digging up old relics of SecComm's time here on the planet. They come back with an armful of scrap metal and outdated tech, filling two segments of the salvage clock.

Hypatia takes a walk about town, looking for signs of the Sniper apparently plaguing Evergreen, and somehow ends up somewhere they really shouldn't be- not the best first impression. They back out of the situation as quickly as possible, but it's not a great first impression- they end up with 1 Difficulty on interacting with Evergreen citizens/administrators until the next full repair.

After a few days of R&R, the party is called to the **Governor's Farm** to meet with Evergreen's Administrator, Patience.

# Evergreen // Early Spring 5014u
## We Could Have Handled This By Text
The party arrives at the governor's farm, passing by some subalterns toiling in the rainy weather. The governmental buildings of Evergreen are decked in Landmark's pale orange and blue.

The party first meets Patience's attache and right hand, **Edena Ji**, who brings them to the administrator's office to meet **Patience**- who presents themselves as a holographic projection of a balding, portly older man.

Patience introduces themselves as a **SIDEWALK-J2 Municipal NHP**, and the current administrator of Evergreen, responsible for overseeing the colony during its early, most vulnerable years. When Evergreen is eventually established and stable, Patience will transfer power to a human council and step down into an advisory role; until then, they are the highest civil authority in the city.

Patience is as calm and measured as their name would suggest. They greet the players politely, and have a long conversation with them regarding their mission and presence upon the planet. In short, Evergreen is dealing with unidentified, armed assailants who have carried on a campaign of attacks upon Evergreen and its surrounding holdings. The soldiers are spreading rumors of massive, weapon-wielding insectoids, a savage predatory species that supposedly once inhabited the planet.

Patience, however, believes that the situation is far less complicated- pulling up combat footage of these "insectoids". Though it initially does appear that Evergreen's militia is being attacked by bugs- dubbed **Egregorians**- the post-combat footage reveals a fallen force to be nothing more than a human in a mechanized exoskeleton, disguised by chunks of chitin and attennae.

Pirates or raiders, Patience says; it is not clear who *exactly* these people are, but the evidence clearly indicates it *is* people. Still, the soldiers spread stories of great savage insects on the battlefield, and any attempts to dispel the rumors only convinces the populace of their truth. Now that the UTF is here, however, Patience is optimistic that they can work together to finally resolve this issue and put an end to all this strife.

Patience freely answers the party's questions regarding the city and the planet, and discusses some possibilities regarding the unknown attackers with them. Although Evergreen is the only official settlement on the planet, in the last few years some members of Evergreen have struck out and formed a few unofficial settlements nearby, collectively dubbed the Gray Towns (for their dubious legal status). Although not officially recognized by Landmark, Evergreen nonetheless maintains friendly relationships with these settlements, mantaining some trade of material and information.

Hypatia suggests that these attackers might be remnants of SecComm, left behind after SecComm abandoned the planet half a millennia ago; Patience concedes this is certainly a possibility, but they've so far failed to take any of their attackers alive to verify this claim- most successfully retreat into the wilds, those that don't are the ones who are killed in combat.

Patience eventually tasks the party with one of two missions- either provide a military escort to Evergreen's engineering corps, the CEC, to repair the flooded landing bowl (to allow Evergreen to recieve future aid and, in the long term, engage in trade), or venture out and track down the Sniper plaguing the city. 

The party elects to escort the engineers, based off of Patience's projections that the sniper will probably eventually retreat on their own. Patience approves, and grants the party a suite of privileges around the city, registering their IDs so they can freely move, are recognized by the defense systems, and can make use of Evergreen's printer to start rebuilding their mechs. Patience invites them to contact them or Edena Ji, if they have questions later.

# Evergreen Landing Bowl // Early Spring 5014u


## Bowl Season
The party meets **Chief Engineer Castor Fielding**, a well built man in his sixties whose body is clearly marked by a lifetime of labor. Fielding is cheerful and ready to go, eager to step out of his managerial role and get back into doing some hands-on work. Pulling a few strings, he pushes the party's mechs to the front of the printer queue.

With LL2 comes a few new mechs; Vesper is now piloting a SSC MONARCH dubbed No Escape, complete with a glittering regal cape and new massive mounted cannons, while Astri has somehow gotten their hands upon a HORUS GOBLIN glittering in the colors of the galaxy, who she names Nebula.

The party begins escorting Engineer Fielding and the CEC out toward the landing bowl, but true to Patience's expectations, they are soon interrupted by gunfire and lasers erupting from the trees. A contingent of mechanized chassis- covered in muck and grime, daubed in the colors of the forest, thunders through the trees to meet them, intent on capturing the CEC vehicles for unknown purposes. 

### Combat Report: Protect the Engineers

An ESCORT sitrep, the party must escort the CEC vehicles across the map while surviving the onslaught of these unknown attackers. There are two vehicles to escort; sucessfully extracting even one will count as a victory, but extracting both will earn some additional favor from Chief Engineer Fielding.

The enemy OPFOR consists of a BASTION, ASSAULT, SCOUT, and RONIN- which is soon joined by additional RONINs creeping out from the trees. The party has met most of these archetypes before, with the RONIN being the only new addition to the roster.

The party initially makes good progress, moving both vehicles simultaneously nearly halfway across the map- until the hostile OPFOR makes contact and prevents the vehicles from moving any further. In particular, the Scout manages to claim *both* vehicles and lay down a cloaking field, rendering it suddenly very difficult to injure its allies or itself, while the increasing tide of RONINs slowly works on carving apart our party's mechs. 

One RONIN is cleaved in half by Rigamarole, only to be replaced by another, rushing in from the forest. The ASSAULT, SCOUT, and BASTION bunker down in the SCOUT's cloaking field, remaining INVISIBLE and holding the CEC Vehicles in place...

Until No Escape chucks a smart mine into their midst, followed immediately by Nebula hurling a Ronin directly into the mine- allowing No Escape to detonate it, hitting four targets with a 2d6 blast. It's not a killer blow, but is quite heavy punishment for grouping so closely together- and *almost* wipes out the SCOUT. In retaliation, the ASSAULT reveals a previously unseen weapon, bombing the party with a surprisingly large-area grenade launcher.
