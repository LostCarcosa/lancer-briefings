# Evergreen // Late Summer, 5014u

After the party retreats to Evergreen, they spend a tense few weeks resting and getting their mechs repaired. Evergreen is on military standby- strict rations are in place and the production of the city has been directed toward wartime materiel. Slowly, the refugees from the Gray Towns arrive in groups, quickly filling up Evergreen's empty apartments and soon forced to camp outside the walls as the city struggles to find space for them.

While walking through the city, **Astri-3133** is startled by the sudden appearance of her wrecked Goblin chassis **Nebula** appearing from thin air and crashing down onto the pavement in front of her;. Upon further investigation, the damage sustained by this wreck is not consistent with the damage taken by **Nebula** last mission. Astri finds a NHP casket inside, though it contains only two relatively mundane files. The first is a `readme.otxt` file containing the following message:
```
hercynia has fallen. this weapon was made from her corpse. 

protect the lonely - trust no one - try again 

- 3132
```
The second file is named `emperor.lcp`, and appears to contain the print schematics for an unfamiliar mech. Though imprinted with SSC's signature, there's no record on the omninet of such a mech existing. Nevertheless, **Astri** swaps it into her print order, and soon is in possession of an Emperor-class frame, which she names **Anthelion**.

CRT Contingency White continues their operations in the background. True to their word, they seem to take little interest in the military operation of Evergreen, and spend most of their time at the Governor's Farm collecting and moving documents and data.

During this time, **Patience** calls the party in to disclose some worrying information. They have recently taken over Evergreen's weather satellite in order to perform some planetary surveys and gather intelligence on the approaching force- and, unexpectedly, has discovered the existence of an entire city on the eastern continent. This stresses **Patience** out immensely- the presence of a native peoples on Hercynia would place Evergreen's charter under serious threat. As representatives of Union, the lancers are responsible for reporting this information back to command.

After repairs are complete, our lancers are sent out on a scouting mission- prodding not at the Machine forces, but at a reported Forest Raider sighting. The party eventually discovers an abandoned camp at the mouth of a tunnel, and as they explore deeper into the caverns, suddenly find themselves faced with a contingent of human scouts.

By fortunate happenstance, the leader of these scouts is **Dthall Ordo**. Dthall and the players deescalate the situation enough to talk, and Dthall explains that her ranger squad is collecting the wounded and retreating after a battle with the Machine gone wrong. She reveals that the 'forest folk' plaguing Evergreen aren't pirates or raiders, but residents of Hercynia, who had incorrectly assumed Evergreen was an ally to the Machine (due to the number of subalterns & drones, combined with the NHP administrator) and therefore gone on a premature offensive. (Even without this complicating factor, Evergreen is not exactly welcome- Hercynia is scarred by a deep distrust of colonizers arriving from space.)

Sensing an opportunity, Dthall makes a proposition to the party. Neither the **Hercynian United Cities** nor Evergreen are likely to fare well on their own against the Machine Horde, so forging an alliance would be mutually beneficial. However, due to the mistrust between the two entities, this is unlikely to happen- so Dthall invites the party back into her city of **Hivehome** in order to act as diplomatic envoys and help her broker this alliance.

At about this time, when the party radios Patience to let them know of these developments and request permission to go... Patience orders them back to Evergreen, as the Machine has begun to mobilize and will likely cut the party off from the city if they don't return immediately. The party manages to convey Dthall's information to Patience, which mostly stresses the Administrator further- the presence of apparently *another* people upon the planet is damning- but Patience expresses his respect for the Lancers and therefore they are allowed to go with Dthall, if they think it would be beneficial.

After some discussion, the party does decide to go with Dthall, who leads them deeper 

## Underground, as the Light Fades

The trek through the tunnels under Hercynia is both long and awkward, with Dthall and her rangers having rather little to say to the party and the tension of the rather recent battles still weighing uneasily in the air. Dthall does take a moment to warn the party that they will likely see a lot of things they are not accustomed to in Hivehome, and that they should keep an open mind- the success of this diplomatic endeavor does depend rather significantly on their ability to be accepted by her people.

After a few days of travel through twisting tunnels, the party is brought to the underground city of **Hivehome**- which resides upon a small chain of islands in the midst of a vast underground ocean, connected by an intricate gondola system and lit by warm lamplight. 

The party's arrival is chaotic- it seems Dthall gave very little advance notice of their arrival, and upon landing on the main island, our lancers are quickly separated from Dthall and their mechs and escorted away under guard. Hivehome's residents don't seem to appreciate the presence of these bogeymen from the surface.

As the party is brought to their temporary accommodations, however, they do spot something important- a large, insectoid creature, wearing a crimson red sash, talking to a human next to them. Apparently, the **Egregorians** yet live here, hidden away from the galaxy- and the party may be the first outsiders to learn of this fact in a long time.


# Hivehome // Late Summer, 5014u

Over the next few days, as the initial hostility fades, the party is given some limited freedom to explore the city (although always under guard, and they are not permitted to leave without Dthall's permission). The party takes advantage of this fairly eagerly, spreading out to explore Hivehome and meet its residents. Their experiences are many, and difficult to summarize, but some key moments:

**Khalid** meets a HUC Drill Sergeant named Konrich Masser, a massive man who challenges Khalid to a bout in his fighting ring. Exploiting his superior agility, Khalid is able to wear Masser down in a long, drawn out bout, earning the sergeant's begrudging respect (much to the dismay of Khalid's ranger escorts, who seem properly terrified of their sergeant).

**Vesper** immediately starts talking to as many Egregorians as they can, meeting **Salt**, an older fisherperson. Salt is gruff and honest, and expresses their distrust of Union and Evergreen. Vesper later also meets **William William**, an unusual Eg who is fanatically obsessed with humanity and the world beyond, and they get along quite well, spending many days together talking about their worlds.

**Astri** visits the street markets, and meets **Winter**- a towering Egregorian Warform the size of a great tank, who wanders the street operating a mobile tea stand. Winter's memory, and their connection to the Witness, is fading, but they seem content enough to spend the rest of their days like this. After securing some spending money from Dthall, Astri buys some silk from an Egregorian craftsperson as a token of her time here in Hivehome.

**Hypatia** visits the museum/university to learn more about the Egregorians and the city itself. In extreme brief, the humans of Hivehome are descendants of SecComm's era- deserters during SecComm's genocide of the Egregorians, or soldiers abandoned on the planet when SecComm withdrew. With the surface having been ravaged by TBK weaponry, these humans retreated down into the maze-like tunnels, forming cities down in the depths. Though SecComm's genocide of the Egregorians was technically successful, the Egregorians of the time recognized their impending doom and scattered as many caches of eggs as they could deep underground in the planet to preserve their species. After a time, the descendants of the human Hercynians discovered some of these egg caches and were able to revive them- and after a few hundred years, the Egregorian race is alive once more, and growing, though still a small minority compared to humans. Revival efforts are still ongoing, as the Hercynian United Cities continues to seek out and recover these ancient egg caches.

Egregorians are capable of a unique language called Witness- a language communicated through memory and experience rather than pure linguistics. They are also capable of inscribing Witness in physical form, allowing for their experience to be recorded in written record. In the hybrid human-Egregorian society, most Egregorians have grown up learning Union Common as well.

Interestingly, humans who spend a lot of time with Egregorians have begun to demonstrate the ability to Witness as well- though it takes much training to bring it to a level on par with the average Egregorian. This seems to indicate that the capacity for Witness is not biological.

## Endeavor

After a few days, the party is sent to meet **Endeavor**- the first Egregorian **Overmind** in a very long time. The **Overmind** acts as a social and cultural leader for Egregorians, and furthermore operates as a sort of 'vessel' for the Witness- containing ancestral memories and communal experiences, and linking together all the Egregorians in their hive to this repository of Witness. 

**Endeavor** is polite and elegant, if distant. They seem interested to meet the first outsiders to set foot in Hivehome, and probe at the party's motivations for being here. They suggest a hypothetical in which the condition for peace is Evergreen's total planetary evacuation, and question how the lancers would feel about this.

Khalid claims he would follow orders. Hypatia tries to soften this by pointing out that orders would *likely* be to comply, knowing Union's ideals. Endeavor accepts this neutrally, giving no indication of their own emotions. The party is soon dismissed.

> *Many have come to this world seeking to help us. I hope you know what that means.*
> - Endeavor

## Goodwill
**Dthall** contacts the party again soon, laying out a plan for the future. The military command of **Daylight**, **Mycol Fields**, and **Hivehome** will soon be meeting in the city to discuss how to proceed with their military operations, which is the ideal opportunity for Dthall and the party to make their case for an alliance. Though the party will likely have Hivehome's support- (Dthall has significant pull in Hivehome, as its human military commander *happens* to be her father), the party will have to make their case to the commanders of the other two cities.

The party has done a good job making sure they are known around Hivehome, and generally cultivating a good reputation with the people. A few days later, Dthall returns with a few more ways to help the party build some more goodwill with the military brass and further bolster their reputation- essentially deputizing the players to assist in some military operations.

The two 'opportunities' the party has are to assist in investigating a Ranger squadron that has lost contact with command, or to assist in an Egregorian egg cache secure & recovery mission. Both require a military presence due to the possibility of the Machine Horde interfering. The party may participate in both, but the mission they take second will be significantly more difficult.

The party opts to help with the egg cache retrieval first, and meets **Terror**- the *Egregorian* half of the Hivehome military command. Terror is a massive Egregorian warform, a massive insect probably capable of punching holes through mechs with their deadly, scythe-like claws- but despite their occupation they seem calm, thoughtful, and peaceful. They request that the party escort an Egregorian revivalist **Bitter** to a possible egg site and protect them from a potential Machine attack.

This is very obviously a test of both the party's reliability and trustworthiness. The party agrees and sets off, traveling with Bitter through the confusing underground tunnels.

Terror's worries about the Machine Horde are well founded, but unnecessary in this instance. When the party arrives at the egg cache site, they find no rusted mechs dredged from the earth- instead, the threat is from the planet itself. A colony of *hive worms* seems to have made the egg cache site into a nesting grounds, and the arrival of the party and Bitter rouses them to attack.

### Combat Report - Annelida

This is a RECON sitrep; the party must locate the egg cache in hostile territory so that Bitter can recover it.
