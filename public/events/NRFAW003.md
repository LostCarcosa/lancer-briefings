# Evergreen // Early Summer, 5014u


Vesper is contacted through outdated comms protocols by a woman named **Dthall Ordo**. In a heavily accented voice, Dthall *apologizes* for the recent attacks- claiming that REGRET's actions were unauthorized, and that she personally was against the level of aggression displayed recently, and requests a ceasefire- asking Vesper to pass the message onto their superiors.

Dthall tells Vesper that her rangers will be pulling back, and it would be in everyone's best interests if Evergreen did not pursue. It seems her fighters are finding themselves now... preoccupied. She leaves Vesper with an ominous warning- something is coming.

Vesper gathers the other lancers and goes to see Patience, which is rather convenient because Patience wants to see them. As they head to the Governor's Farm, they notice that Evergreen's subalterns and drones are beginning to act strangely, reminiscent of the incident at the Chau Farm- drifting listlessly away from their handlers. They seem to be moving eastward.

Patience is worried. Before Vesper can even begin telling them about the call, Patience begins talking about their own concerns- describing a "signal" detected somewhere to the east, across the sea. It reminds them of the incident at Chau Maize. They wonder briefly if this is simply an issue with their own cognition- but no, this seems to be external. More worryingly, it seems to have gotten stronger in the last few hours.

Patience pulls up video feeds of the area around Evergreen, revealing that the subaltern issue is more severe than it originally appeared. The city's autonomous robots are beginning to flood out of its walls en masse, all heading eastward. Additionally, there are signs of hostile OPFOR on the perimeter- unidentified chassis appearing in the wilderness.

Worse yet, Patience is due for cycling. The terms of their contact with Landmark binds them to a very strict cycling schedule, and now it comes at a very inconvenient time for them. Patience will be essentially out of commission for the next 24-48 hours, starting in the evening. Edena Ji is in charge when Patience is under, and the lancers are given broad permission to make whatever preparations they deem necessary (with Commander Hadura's approval, at least.)

Before they go down, Patience puts the militia on alert and gives the party their orders. Head east and investigate the signal. 

The party follows the marching of subalterns and drones a distance eastward, until they reach the base of Signal Tower 3.

# Tower 3 // Early Summer, 5014u
A great gathering of subalterns stands at the base of Tower 3, digging into the earth- accompanied by their larger industrial brethren. The party attempts to report this back to Evergreen, though without Patience's omnipresent availability, they are subjected to the limitations of Edena's schedule- and before contact is properly made, Astri's baby Technophile picks up on some large-scale vibrations emerging from within the earth.

The party retreats as their mechs radiation alarms begin to go off, followed by their large-mass proximity alarms. As they step back, the earth erupts in a gout of surging machine- hundreds of excavating subalterns wiped away in a second as a wave of subalterns and mechs begin to pour out of some hidden underground passage, dressed in makeshift armor and rags. 

At first, they come crawling and clambering, but soon they are marching in orderly, endless ranks, grinding the mud beneath their feet- a great legion, pouring out of the ground like an unstoppable tide.

The call back home is finally patched through, to Edena's horror. The party flees.

### Combat Report: Sepulcher

The single objective of this sitrep is for the party to escape before the spreading machine horde overtakes and consumes them. The party must race across the map to the extraction zone before they are killed.

The enemy OPFOR is endless, and comes in waves. Each wave consists of:
- GOLIATH
- DEMOLISHER
- 4 BERSERKER GRUNTS
*or*
- BREACHER
- 4 BERSERKER GRUNTS

Though the party initially makes good progress, they must squeeze through a valley (or climb up its walls) to reach the extraction zone on the other side. The GOLIATHs soon prove an obstacle as they use their immense girth to plug up the most direct route, holding their ground while BERSERKERS and BREACHERS close in to wreak havok.

**Diplomacy** is able to demonstrate her new Synthetic Muscle Netting, acquired after facing the Heavy DEMOLISHER in the last mission, to chuck the GOLIATHs out of the way- but even with her new power, has to work extremely hard to *keep* the GOLIATHs from punching their way back long enough for her allies to slip through. 

**Rhythmless Walk** is able to reach the extraction zone with their superior movement speed, and escapes safely. Diplomacy is able to reach the area as well, but stays to help her allies escape. While **No Escape** soon finds herself pinned down- blocked by what are now *multiple* GOLIATHs in the front, and encroaching DEMOLISHERS & BREACHERS from the side, **Nebula** decides to scale the valley walls instead, opting to brave the tide of BERSERKER GRUNTS doing the same thing.

Diplomacy is able to use her SMN to grapple, ram, and Hellion Shield enough GOLIATHs out of the way for No Escape to slip through and evacuate. However, she delays her own evacuation further and invokes Power at a Cost to pull Nebula from the threat of multiple BERSERKERS- and, combined with the damage she had already taken, structures for the second time, rolls snake eyes, and collapses. Hypatia is forced to flee on foot, while Nebula drags as much of Diplomacy as they can behind them as they flee.

**This combat does not change any of the extant clocks. 1 mech is destroyed; two others have taken moderate damage.**

## Gray Towns Evacuation
Our lancers manage to escape the endless forces of the Machine Horde, and find a quiet spot to make repairs. The other lancers donate enough repair cap to help get Diplomacy's wreck functional again, and generally patch up their own frames to near-full capacity, while Edena informs them of a troubling development- Signal Tower 3 isn't the *only* place the Machine Army is pouring from. There are two other gashes in the land, vomiting out more of the rusted army. Panicked- and tasked with the defense of Evergreen from this threat- Edena ends the call without giving the party any new orders.

The party manages to capture a stray drone and gets Astri-3133 to hack into its systems- revealing some of the immediate plans of the Horde. They confirm that orders are currently being issued by root-level user `BEGGAR_ONE`, and that the immediate plans of the Horde is to merge into one great army, devour the Gray Towns for supplies & materiel- then advance onto Evergreen proper.

As the party begins to brainstorm plans, they receive a distress call from Jacob Merrick, mayor of one of the Gray Towns- requesting immediate aid. They, too, have seen the great horde of metal heading for their position, and make the very prudent call to evacuate the Towns immediately, fleeing their homes for the much more defendable position of Evergreen.

However, evacuating the thousands of civilians in the Gray Towns on such short notice is a difficult task, and the humid rain does the evacuation no favors. The roads to Evergreen were never built to handle this volume of traffic, and quickly become bogged down and laden with traffic as cars break down and stall out.

Our party arrives to assist, plying their talents wherever they can. Hypatia makes further use of SMN to drag a mobile home from where it's stuck in the mud, while Astri uses her technological talents to fix up two badly damaged trucks that have plugged the road after a nasty collision. Vesper drives off some of the Hercynian megafauna- horse-sized crustaceans- that are blocking the caravan, while Khalid heads off to warn one an isolationist gray town about the encroaching danger (and gets heavily shot at while trying to convince them to evacuate, as due to recent events they have a serious distrust of mechs.) Overall, the party contributes positively to the evacuation, and proves themselves fairly good at directing the chaotic flow of people and machinery, earning themselves a reserve for the next mission.

As the refugees move toward Evergreen, Merrick contacts the party to ask for one more favor. The Horde is quickly approaching- he needs somebody to slow them down to ensure everybody has the time to escape... 

The party prepares to engage the Horde on a rainy roadside, among trucks and cars abandoned by the fleeing Gray Town citizens.

The party must hold the central crossroad position for 6 rounds against a tide of enemies. The party is composed of:

- Astri-3133 | Nebula | GOBLIN
- Vesper | No Escape | MONARCH
- Khalid | Rhythmless Walk | DEATH'S HEAD
- Hypatia | Diplomacy | ORCHIS

The enemy OPFOR consists of:
- [The Weapon] - ELITE AVENGER
- SCOURER
- 2x PRIEST
- 2x PYRO
- ASSASSIN
- 2x GRUNT BERSERKER
- 2x GRUNT ASSAULT
- [The Other Weapon] - VETERAN AVENGER



The sitrep begins with only [The Weapon] and a SCOURER, PRIEST, and PYRO deployed- but more enemies begin pouring in every round, slowly flooding the field with Machine units. Like the previous Machine units fought, these mechs seem to be remotely-piloted; unlike previous encounters, these are no longer just ag-drones and industrial equipment gone haywire, but proper wartime machinery, dredged up from the earth for t heir terrible purpose.

The party scans [The Weapon], learning that they get stronger if any of their (non-grunt) allies are killed near them, and appropriately decide that [The Weapon] must die first. This proves much more difficult than expected, as the PRIEST and PYRO immediately stack their defensive buffs on their leader, cloaking them in a pseudo-invisibility field and granting them resistance to damage- all while [The Weapon] proves to be an exceedingly dangerous frontline damage dealer with a hard-hitting shotgun combined with a longer-range pistol. **No Escape** takes heavy damage in the early rounds, as they are the easiest target for most of the damage-dealing forces to reach.

Though unable to truly endure the combined assault of **Diplomacy**, **No Escape**, and **Rhythmless Walk**, [The Weapon] does hold out for long enough that multiple waves of reinforcements are able to arrive- including [The Other Weapon], who is able to take advantage of [The Weapon]'s death:

> “We learned from you: when one of your appendages fell, you responded. Some would coalesce around it, to repair it and give it comfort. Others would despair (we ignored these). Finally, some would fly into a rage and redouble their efforts. This was the most useful of responses, and so we adopted it.”
> 
> *Imperative code (translated), broadcast by machine unit [The Other Weapon]*

This proves to be the beginning of the end for our lancers. [The Other Weapon] steps into the open and reveals that they have discarded the shotgun for a brutal integrated buzzsaw. In a single shot, [The Other Weapon] aims its pistol towards No Escape and takes them out of the fight instantly. (2 structure remaining, direct hit.)

During this time, **Nebula** has been diligently working on crowd control, jamming and puppeteering the Machine forces to limit their effectiveness while remaining safely in the backline. The Machine ASSASSIN, however, finds this rather disagreeable, and utilizes their impressive movement abilities to cross half the map and reach Nebula's position. At the same time, a PRIEST hits Nebula with an Abjuration, punishing them with heat every time they try any hacking. 

Nebula delays the ASSASSIN from reaching them with a little more puppeteering, but is forced to overheat in order to wipe multiple grunts from the field, EXPOSING themselves in the process. The ASSASSIN takes immediate advantage, knocking them prone and stabbing into them for a heavy 16 damage hit and causes critical structure damage, shattering the mech. (2 structure remaining, direct hit.)

This leaves only two lancers remaining. Rhythmless Walk is brought down to ground level as the truck they're perching on is destroyed, and their own heat-generating weapons combined with more PRIEST abjuration causes them to soon overheat, EXPOSING themselves as well. [The Other Weapon] instantly takes advantage of this, and sets its brutal buzzsaw to its cruel purpose- landing a *30* damage critical hit on the sniper. Khalid braces this, but the crippled mech finds itself easy prey for the lingering ASSASSIN, who finishes the wounded mech off. (1 structure remaining, direct hit.) One Lancer remains.

At this point the writing is on the wall, but Diplomacy opts to fight until the end. It seems that [The Weapon] may have posthumously won the sitrep for the Machine; all the energy spent killing [The Weapon] spared its allies from the same damage, resulting in a large bloc of Machine forces surviving until the end to claim the control zone. The remaining OPFOR tear Diplomacy apart, sending our human lancers fleeing on foot back to Evergreen.

**Combat Lost. The Machine Horde clock ticks up by 1 segment, and the slowest Gray Towns refugees are overrun and killed by the Horde.**
