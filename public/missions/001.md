# Mission // #001
## The Drop
# Goals
- Land at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Saber and await further orders.

# Mission Parameters
- Information limited at this time. Hostile forces are confirmed to be operating within Nov Elysia, so anticipate enemy contact; you are cleared to engage if fired upon.

# Stakes
- Failure to rendezvous at FOB Saber in a timely fashion will result in delays, setting the operation's timetable back and narrowing the window of opportunity to rescue Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.

# Reserves
- You have no reserves at the moment.
