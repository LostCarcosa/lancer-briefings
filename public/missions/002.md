# Mission // #002
## Daybreak
# Goals
- Neutralize the enemy's comms jamming network so that Rio can track down Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.
- Locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.

# Mission Parameters
- Intel places nearest transmitter within a nearby financial/commercial district. The area is densely packed with tall buildings, and there are reports that the Vestan Sovereignty has begun to deploy air assets in defense of its strongpoints throughout the city.
- The existence of the jamming network also indicates that the Sovereignty forces have significant electronic warfare assets at their disposal; anticipate systemic invasiona nd localized sensor jamming/optical camouflage-equivalent capabilities.

# Stakes
- Failure to neutralize the enemy jamming network on schedule will result in heavy Sovereignty resistance against the LSA advance, resulting in heavy casualties for LSA and hindering their ability to retake the city effectively.
- Failure to locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee will likely result in them being taken prisoner, or even killed.

# Reserves
- Depends.
