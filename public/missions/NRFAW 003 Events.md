# Evergreen // Early Summer, 5014u


Vesper is contacted through outdated comms protocols by a woman named **Dthall Ordo**. In a heavily accented voice, Dthall *apologizes* for the recent attacks- claiming that REGRET's actions were unauthorized, and that she personally was against the level of aggression displayed recently, and requests a ceasefire- asking Vesper to pass the message onto their superiors.

Dthall tells Vesper that her rangers will be pulling back, and it would be in everyone's best interests if Evergreen did not pursue. It seems her fighters are finding themselves now... preoccupied. She leaves Vesper with an ominous warning- something is coming.

Vesper gathers the other lancers and goes to see Patience, which is rather convenient because Patience wants to see them. As they head to the Governor's Farm, they notice that Evergreen's subalterns and drones are beginning to act strangely, reminiscent of the incident at the Chau Farm- drifting listlessly away from their handlers. They seem to be moving eastward.

Patience is worried. Before Vesper can even begin telling them about the call, Patience begins talking about their own concerns- describing a "signal" detected somewhere to the east, across the sea. It reminds them of the incident at Chau Maize. They wonder briefly if this is simply an issue with their own cognition- but no, this seems to be external. More worryingly, it seems to have gotten stronger in the last few hours.

Patience pulls up video feeds of the area around Evergreen, revealing that the subaltern issue is more severe than it originally appeared. The city's autonomous robots are beginning to flood out of its walls en masse, all heading eastward. Additionally, there are signs of hostile OPFOR on the perimeter- unidentified chassis appearing in the wilderness.

Worse yet, Patience is due for cycling. The terms of their contact with Landmark binds them to a very strict cycling schedule, and now it comes at a very inconvenient time for them. Patience will be essentially out of commission for the next 24-48 hours, starting in the evening. Edena Ji is in charge when Patience is under, and the lancers are given broad permission to make whatever preparations they deem necessary (with Commander Hadura's approval, at least.)

Before they go down, Patience puts the militia on alert and gives the party their orders. Head east and investigate the signal.
